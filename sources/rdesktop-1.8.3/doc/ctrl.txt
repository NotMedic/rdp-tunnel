Overview
========

The protocol is a UTF-8 line based bidirectional protocol were a slave sends
a method with optional argument to the master and a result of operation is
returned to the slave in a synchronous send recv operation.


A method call from Slave to the Master have the following syntax:

	METHOD [ARG1[ ARG2 [...]]]

Argument string sent for a method call should be escaped as descibed below under 
String escaping section.


A result from Master to the Slave have the following syntax:

	"OK" || "ERROR" <CODE>

Result CODE is specific to the method implementation except for 0xffffffff which
is internal to the protocol and means that method does not exist.


One line may not exceed 1024 bytes, including newline.


String escaping
===============
Percentage sign has been choosen as escaping character.

The rules for escaping are:

        Characters < 32 and % are escaped to %xx where xx is the byte value of the
        escaped character.
